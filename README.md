# Music-Generation-with-WaveGAN

In this study, we utilize the WaveGAN architecture to generate music segments. The study is conducted on the GTZAN music genre classification dataset, comprised of 100 30-second music segments with 10 genre classes. The evaluation metrics used are the Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and the Inception score (IS) to assess the quality of the generated samples against the real samples.

Generated music segments are available to listen to.
